## Why RevOK?

This is somewhat of an obscure reference from the 1981 movie *Scanners*.

Private military company ConSec recruits "scanners" – super-powered individuals capable of telepathy and psychokinesis – and uses them in service of the company.
However, when one of ConSec's scanners demonstrates his powers at a marketing event, the volunteer – Darryl Revok – turns out to be a more powerful scanner, who causes the ConSec scanner's head to explode.

This is how that scene ends:

In short, RevOK makes scanners explode.
